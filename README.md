**Little bit of me:** I am an above average graduate from electrical engineering. My programming career started when I got placed into an IT services company and leaving all basics, I just got pushed into Java Web programming. Over a period, I see that my heart is with programming and started pursuing it seriously.

**Programming Career:** 
When it comes to programming , there are various nuances of application programming - Front End Mark up languages (HTML, XHTML, DHTML, VXML), Client side scripting, Styling, Web frameworks, Stand alone solutions, Mobile Apps, Middle ware solutions, Data Access, Queuing, Caching, Logging, RESTFul & SOAP Web services, SOA, Micro Services, Code Versioning, Data Security, Web Security, Code Versioning, SQL & NoSQL Databases, Cloud, Big Data, Application Servers, Build Tools, Performance Tuning & Others and with the advent of open source, there are multiple implementations available in each of the above areas. Open source is a boon where many developers can leverage it as a solution for Enterprises. It is a bane as there are many open source APIs, frameworks & practices which makes a programmer's life horrible as he has to keep track of them continuously. However with a structured approach, one can keep track of these updates.

**My Approach:**
* Dont try to learn everything and yearn for expertise. End of the day you will be exasperated unless you are a Leonardo Da Vinci.
* Try to know about most of the technologies by outlining their purpose, role and performance when compared to other alternatives.
* Categorize technology into zones and keep track of existing implementations and listen for any updates.
* Love your Family & Job, that should be your first priority and at the same time, plan carefully and dedicate time for your learning.
* Keep track of your technology exposure and plan for learning a new technology every month.

**Why this notes?:**
Let me take an example - Data Security. How can we make sure that your application has its data secured to a certain level? There is no starting point for this and many get lost in searching for best practices, browsing through hundred's of pages. In this notes I tried to compile my experience with various implementations & learning with a more meaningful & easy to understand approach. It is definitely not a one stop solution, but definitely a starting point. Enjoy!!!!
